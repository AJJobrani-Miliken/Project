    "Childhood immunization remains one of the highest-value public health interventions in the United States. Yet vaccine delays continue to widen immunization gaps in underserved urban areas, where structural barriers, fragmented follow-up, and inconsistent primary-care engagement undermine coverage. Washington, DC has experienced rising pockets of under-immunization, particularly among children receiving care in high-density, socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods such as Columbia Heights. These delays elevate the risk of outbreaks for measles, pertussis, varicella, and invasive bacterial diseases, all of which remain highly sensitive to lapses in routine vaccination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clinical site analyzed in this project participates in a larger improvement initiative that secured federal funding to increase childhood vaccination coverage across the District, with explicit targets: raising up-to-date rates at age two and achieving a two-dose MMR completion rate by age five, both with a 7 percent improvement by 30 September 2025. To meaningfully track progress toward these goals, a rigorous baseline analysis is required that quantifies the magnitude, distribution, and correlates of vaccine delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a cohort of 383 de-identified pediatric records from the Children’s National primary care clinic in Columbia Heights. For each child, Cerner’s ACIP-aligned forecasting system provides vaccine-specific due dates, updated for catch-up logic and minimum intervals. Days overdue therefore reflect true clinical delay, not clerical artifact. The dataset captures delays across all major vaccines: DTaP, Polio (IPV), Hepatitis A and B, Varicella, Hib, MMR, and Pneumococcal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccination delay in this population appears to stem less from vaccine hesitancy and more from loss to follow-up, insurance churn, unstable housing, and appointment non-completion. Without quantitative mapping of delay patterns, the clinic cannot accurately target outreach, evaluate workflow redesign, or allocate staff for high-risk subpopulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-assisted data science offers an opportunity to transform how the clinic monitors care gaps. By pairing Python-based analytics with generative tools, this project produces a reproducible pipeline that visualizes delay burden, estimates risk of sustained delay, and supports decision making for quality-improvement interventions. Techniques include descriptive statistics, distributional analysis, heatmaps of vaccine-type delay, simple machine-learning classification, and an interactive prototype for exploring patient-level patterns."

    "Objective 1: Establish a clinic-level baseline for all ACIP-recommended vaccines.\n",
    "Formally quantify the magnitude of overdue vaccination across the clinic population by calculating days overdue for each vaccine series.

    "Develop a Python-based, AI-enhanced workflow using pandas, seaborn, and Plotly to visualize delays, evaluate distributional patterns, and generate actionable metrics. This includes anomaly detection, identification of high-risk patterns, and evaluating the potential impact of improvements toward the 7 percent coverage goal.\n",

    "Objective 3: Use machine learning to explore predictors of extended delay and support targeted outreach.\n",
    "Train a lightweight classification model to estimate probability of >900-day delays, testing whether factors such as multi-vaccine delinquency, prior delays, or clinic-interaction patterns predict risk. The goal is not high-stakes prediction, but rather demonstrating how AI can guide case-management strategies and staff allocation.\n",

    "Objective 4: Prototype an interactive dashboard for real-time vaccination-gap monitoring.\n",
    "Create a minimal viable product (MVP) Shiny-like or Streamlit-based interface that allows clinic leads to filter data by vaccine, age, and delay severity. This showcases how AI-supported tools can strengthen situational awareness and accelerate quality-improvement cycles.\n"

    "### II. Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent scholarship on childhood immunization in the United States consistently shows that overall vaccination coverage masks substantial variation in timeliness, with delayed or missed vaccines contributing disproportionately to outbreaks of measles, pertussis, and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Analyses using the National Immunization Survey–Child (NIS-Child) demonstrate that although most children eventually receive recommended vaccines, delays and incomplete series remain common, particularly in urban and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations (Luman et al., 2002; Hill et al., 2018). These delays are not trivial: even brief periods of susceptibility in infancy have been linked to higher outbreak risk and increased community vulnerability (Phadke et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeliness has emerged as a central metric in the literature because it provides a more accurate picture of population risk than simple up-to-date status at age 24 months. Early work by Luman and colleagues showed that children classified as “fully vaccinated” by age two often experienced months of avoidable susceptibility earlier in life due to delays (Luman et al., 2005). More recent research finds that delayed vaccination clusters geographically and socially, with strong associations between underimmunization and factors such as Medicaid insurance, caregiver language barriers, unstable housing, and missed well-child visits (Hill et al., 2018; O’Leary et al., 2020). Urban pediatric clinics serving communities of color often shoulder the greatest burden of these structural challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic further destabilized immunization systems. CDC data show significant reductions in pediatric vaccine ordering and administration in 2020–2021, with only partial recovery in subsequent years (Patel et al., 2022). Kindergarten two-dose MMR coverage declined nationally, falling below the 95 percent threshold required to reliably prevent measles outbreaks (CDC, 2023). State and local health departments, including DC Health, have documented persistent declines in routine childhood vaccine completion and widening disparities in on-time vaccination (DC Health, 2023). In this context, even modest absolute percentage-point gains at a single clinic can meaningfully influence herd immunity in high-risk neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature identifies several structural and health-system factors driving underimmunization. Missed opportunities during acute visits, lack of reminder–recall systems, fragmented records across care sites, and inconsistent use of standing orders all contribute to delayed vaccination (Jacobson et al., 2017). For many families, logistical barriers such as transportation, unpredictable work schedules, limited clinic hours, and unstable phone access further impede timely vaccination (O’Leary et al., 2020). Qualitative research highlights the role of mistrust, prior negative healthcare experiences, and insurance or immigration complexities in shaping real-world uptake patterns among historically marginalized communities (Glanz et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronic health records (EHRs) and immunization information systems (IIS) have become essential tools for improving on-time vaccination. Forecasting engines embedded in EHRs such as Cerner Millennium translate the ACIP schedule into automated logic that identifies children who are overdue or at risk of falling behind (Shah et al., 2018). When paired with reminder–recall outreach, standing orders, and nurse-led population management, EHR-based interventions have demonstrated improvements in timeliness and reductions in missed opportunities (Szilagyi et al., 2020). Yet many clinics underuse these tools: forecasting information may be buried in the chart interface, rarely summarized for population-level analysis, and inconsistently used to drive proactive outreach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emerging research highlights the potential of artificial intelligence and machine-learning methods to augment traditional immunization quality improvement. Predictive models using registry or EHR data can identify children at high risk of vaccination delay or dropout, enabling more efficient, targeted outreach (Horne et al., 2021). In parallel, digital nudges such as SMS reminders, automated phone calls, and app-based prompts have shown measurable improvements in childhood vaccination rates, especially in underserved communities (Stockwell et al., 2015). Although much of this work has been conducted in large health systems, the foundational logic applies directly to urban primary care clinics: high-quality EHR data can be transformed into actionable dashboards, risk scores, and outreach workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present project sits squarely within these evidence streams. By using ACIP-based forecast fields in the dataset to define “days overdue,” the analysis adheres to nationally recognized schedule logic while avoiding reconstruction of complex ACIP algorithms. Focusing on a single Washington, DC clinic panel enables granular examination of delay patterns, clustering of overdue status for key vaccines (for example, DTaP, MMR, PCV13), and identification of children at greatest risk of prolonged underimmunization. The project’s use of Python analytics and machine-learning classification operationalizes the broader literature on EHR-driven quality improvement and provides a practical foundation for testing whether AI-enhanced workflows can help close gaps in a historically underserved urban population.\n",

    "### III. Data Preparation and Preliminary Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is structured as an exploratory analysis of childhood vaccination delays within a Washington, DC pediatric population. The goal is not to test formal hypotheses or establish causal relationships, but to investigate patterns of overdue vaccination, determine which vaccines contribute most to persistent delays, and evaluate the potential of AI-enhanced analytics for public health decision making. This preliminary work establishes a baseline for future interventions at the clinic level and provides the analytic foundation needed for predictive modeling and dashboard development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of **383 de-identified pediatric records** extracted from the Children’s National primary care clinic in Columbia Heights. Each row represents an individual child, and each column corresponds to a specific Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) vaccine series. For each vaccine, the electronic health record (Cerner Millennium) generates an ACIP-aligned forecast that includes due dates, minimum intervals, catch-up logic, and an indicator for whether a child is currently overdue. In this dataset, overdue status is measured in **days overdue**, which reflects how far behind the child is relative to the recommended schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vaccines included in the analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis)**\n",
    "2. **IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine)**\n",
    "3. **Hepatitis A**\n",
    "4. **Hepatitis B**\n",
    "5. **MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)**\n",
    "6. **Varicella**\n",
    "7. **Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b)**\n",
    "8. **Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each variable represents the number of days overdue at the time of extraction. Values of zero indicate on-time vaccination. Positive values indicate delay. Missing values typically reflect a completed vaccine series for which no forecast applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for Data Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was selected because it provides a granular, clinically meaningful view of real-world immunization performance at a single urban pediatric clinic serving a diverse and historically underserved population. Unlike aggregate immunization coverage rates, which collapse complex patterns into a binary up-to-date indicator, days-overdue values capture the depth and distribution of delays across multiple vaccine series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all variables derive from the same ACIP decision-support engine, they share consistent logic and measurement structure. This consistency permits exploratory data analysis, cross-vaccine comparisons, correlation mapping, and the application of machine-learning models to identify children at greatest risk of sustained underimmunization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection and Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data were extracted directly from the clinic’s Cerner Millennium system, which uses an automated ACIP decision-support engine that integrates minimum ages, minimum intervals, grace periods, prior doses, contraindications, and catch-up rules. For this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each vaccine column reflects **current days overdue** at the time of data extraction.\n",
    "- No manual edits, imputations, or recalculations were applied to the underlying values.\n",
    "- Identifiers were removed to ensure confidentiality and IRB alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset therefore provides a standardized representation of ACIP timelines without requiring manual reconstruction of schedule logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning and Preprocessing Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing was performed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. Steps included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardizing variable names:**  \n",
    "   All column names were cleaned and made machine readable (for example, `days_overdue_MMR`, `days_overdue_DTaP`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling missing data:**  \n",
    "   Missing values were preserved and treated as clinically meaningful, since they often indicate a completed series rather than missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type conversion:**  \n",
    "   Numeric variables were converted to integer or float types to enable descriptive statistics and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initial descriptive statistics:**  \n",
    "   Summary measures (mean, median, range, variance) were generated to identify extreme delays, skewness, and clustering patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exploratory visualizations:**  \n",
    "   Histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps were constructed to explore variability across vaccines and examine correlations in delay patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the dataset is standardized and clinically grounded, several limitations affect interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-clinic sample:**  \n",
    "  Findings may not generalize to broader DC or national populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-sectional extraction:**  \n",
    "  The dataset reflects delays at one point in time and does not capture when delays began or whether children are catching up.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unmeasured social determinants:**  \n",
    "  Barriers such as transportation, scheduling conflicts, insurance gaps, or caregiver work constraints are not captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential undocumented vaccines:**  \n",
    "  If vaccines were administered outside the system but not documented, delays may be overestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations highlight opportunities for future data enrichment but do not diminish the dataset’s value for exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjustments and Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "To support analysis and future modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw values were maintained to preserve interpretability.\n",
    "- Log transformations were considered for skewed distributions.\n",
    "- Derived variables were created to summarize overall delay burden across vaccine series.\n",
    "- Data were kept at the individual level to allow clustering analysis and machine-learning model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a robust foundation for analyzing childhood vaccination delays in an urban pediatric population. Through structured preprocessing, exploratory visualizations, and AI-assisted analytic techniques, the project develops a reproducible baseline that can guide targeted outreach strategies, staffing decisions, quality-improvement cycles, and public health interventions designed to improve immunization timeliness in Washington, DC.\n"

    "## V. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses an exploratory analytic approach to examine childhood vaccination delay patterns in the Columbia Heights pediatric population. The goal is to characterize overdue immunizations, quantify delay severity, and identify meaningful patterns that can guide future public health quality improvement efforts. The methodology emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, and alignment with best practices in data science and public health research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.a. Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of an export from the Columbia Heights primary care panel generated through the Cerner electronic health record (EHR). It includes 383 pediatric patients and contains forecast fields that indicate each child’s immunization status across all ACIP-recommended vaccine series. Forecast fields specify whether a vaccine is “Up-to-date” or list the number of days overdue based on ACIP guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents one patient, and fields include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demographic identifiers  \n",
    "- Clinic location  \n",
    "- Forecast status for DTaP, Polio, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Varicella, HIB, MMR, and Pneumococcal vaccines  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cerner’s decision support logic, updated for 2025 ACIP recommendations, serves as the basis for the forecast values used in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.b. Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because forecast fields contain text descriptors rather than numerical values, the first major step involved converting these fields into quantitative indicators of delay. A custom function parsed each forecast string and extracted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A numeric count of days overdue  \n",
    "- A binary indicator for whether the vaccine was overdue or up-to-date  \n",
    "\n",
    "Up-to-date values were assigned a numeric delay of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess overall immunization status at the patient level, two composite measures were created:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The total number of vaccine series for which a child was overdue  \n",
    "2. The cumulative number of overdue days across all series  \n",
    "\n",
    "These measures allow evaluation of both breadth and depth of delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard cleaning steps were performed to ensure analytic reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removal of empty or malformed fields  \n",
    "- Consistent formatting across all forecast columns  \n",
    "- Validation that each row represented a unique patient  \n",
    "\n",
    "### V.c. Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the project’s exploratory focus, the analysis relies on descriptive statistics and visualization-based methods. These techniques support pattern identification without implying causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core analytic elements included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributional plots for numeric days overdue  \n",
    "- Frequency analysis of the number of overdue vaccines per child  \n",
    "- Heatmaps to detect co-occurrence of delays across vaccine series  \n",
    "- Summary statistics for mean and median delays  \n",
    "- Cross-series comparison of overdue proportions  \n",
    "\n",
    "These methods collectively capture both individual vaccine performance and patient-level immunization completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.d. Categorization of Delay Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "To support interpretability and clinical relevance, an ordinal delay severity classification was created:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On-time (zero delay)  \n",
    "- Mild delay (up to one year overdue)  \n",
    "- Moderate delay (one to two years overdue)  \n",
    "- Severe delay (more than two years overdue)  \n",
    "\n",
    "These categories offer a structured framework for understanding risk gradients and are consistent with public health practices in immunization timeliness monitoring. They also provide a basis for future targeting of outreach or follow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.e. Analytical Tools and Computing Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "All analyses were conducted using Python within Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook. The following Python packages were employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pandas for data cleaning and manipulation  \n",
    "- numpy for numeric operations  \n",
    "- seaborn and matplotlib for visualization  \n",
    "- scikit-learn preprocessing modules for potential modeling extensions  \n",
    "\n",
    "This computing environment supports reproducibility, version control through GitHub, and integration with AI-assisted code generation tools, which aligns with the course requirement to maximize responsible use of generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V.f. Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains only de-identified clinic data used for public health quality improvement and educational purposes. No protected health information is included. Analyses focus exclusively on population-level trends and avoid individual prediction or profiling. The purpose of this project is to strengthen public health practice and immunization program performance through structured evaluation of timeliness patterns.\n",

    "This analysis was conducted using Python inside Jupyter notebooks running through Visual Studio Code. The workflow begins with data ingestion and inspection, including procedures to confirm the absence of personal identifiers. Data cleaning steps include verification of variable types, assessment of missing values, conversion of overdue days to numeric formats, and stratification of records by patient age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory analysis proceeds with univariate and bivariate evaluations of overdue vaccination burden. Kernel density estimates, histograms, and boxplots are used to visualize distributional patterns across ages. Overdue burden is analyzed both continuously and categorically to capture clinically relevant thresholds of delay. The clinic’s baseline performance is then contextualized by examining variation across age groups and vaccine categories.\n",

Although the dataset is relatively small, the ML component demonstrates how these tools can support early outreach strategies.\n",
