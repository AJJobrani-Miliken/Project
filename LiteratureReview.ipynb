    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas and one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies. Each year in the United States, it leads to more than 350,000 hospitalizations and over $2.6 billion in direct healthcare costs. While most people recover quickly with mild disease, about one in four develop severe acute pancreatitis (SAP)—a life-threatening condition that causes organ failure, overwhelming inflammation, and a high risk of infections. Despite decades of research, there are still no approved medications that directly target the inflammation driving severe disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "One promising approach comes from omega-3 fatty acids, a type of healthy fat found in fish oil and certain plants. The two main forms, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), are well known for their ability to calm inflammation and support immune function. In other critical illnesses, omega-3s have been shown to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce inflammatory signals like IL-6 and TNF-α\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve blood vessel and immune cell function\n",
    "\n",
    "Decrease oxidative stress, which damages tissues\n",
    "\n",
    "In pancreatitis, early clinical trials suggest omega-3 supplementation—especially when delivered through intravenous nutrition—may reduce infections, shorten hospital stays, and in some cases, even lower the risk of death.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the evidence so far is fragmented and inconsistent. Past studies differ in who they enrolled, how much omega-3 they gave, and the form of supplementation used. International guidelines (such as those from ESPEN) do not currently recommend omega-3s in routine pancreatitis care because there are no large, definitive trials. A critical unanswered question is: does the dose matter? Are benefits only seen at certain thresholds or in specific subgroups, such as patients with severe disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is the first dose-stratified systematic review and meta-analysis of omega-3 fatty acids in acute pancreatitis. By synthesizing data from randomized clinical trials and grouping outcomes by dose, we aim to clarify whether higher or lower levels of omega-3s provide meaningful benefits. Outcomes of interest include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mortality\n",
    "\n",
    "Organ failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Infections\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflammatory biomarkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Length of hospital stay\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions, this research could help guide precision nutrition strategies for pancreatitis and lay the foundation for larger, more targeted clinical trials."

    "Study Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). This work follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eligibility Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Study type: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Population: Adult patients (≥18 years) diagnosed with acute pancreatitis\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervention: Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA, or combinations), administered via any route (parenteral or enteral)\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparator: Standard nutrition, placebo, or other lipid formulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mortality\n",
    "\n",
    "Organ failure (new or persistent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Infectious complications\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, CRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Length of hospital stay\n",
    "\n",
    "Search Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We searched the following databases from inception through [insert date, e.g., September 2025]:\n",
    "\n",
    "PubMed/MEDLINE\n",
    "\n",
    "Embase\n",
    "\n",
    "Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "ClinicalTrials.gov\n",
    "\n",
    "The search strategy combined terms for “acute pancreatitis,” “omega-3 fatty acids,” “fish oil,” “EPA,” and “DHA.” We also hand-searched reference lists of prior reviews to identify additional studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Two reviewers independently extracted data on:\n",
    "\n",
    "Study design and sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient characteristics (age, severity of pancreatitis, comorbidities)\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervention details (formulation, dose, route, timing, duration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes (mortality, organ failure, infections, biomarkers, length of stay)\n",
    "\n",
    "Disagreements were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dose Stratification\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the question of whether omega-3 benefits are dose-dependent, trials were grouped into categories based on daily administered dose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Low dose (<1 g/day EPA+DHA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moderate dose (1–3 g/day)\n",
    "\n",
    "High dose (>3 g/day)\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework allows comparison of outcomes across different dosing thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "We assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, evaluating randomization, blinding, incomplete data, selective reporting, and other biases. Certainty of evidence for each outcome was rated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for binary outcomes (e.g., mortality, infection) and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes (e.g., length of stay).\n",
    "\n",
    "A random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) was used to account for between-study heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic, with >50% considered substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subgroup analyses were performed by dose level, route of administration, and severity of pancreatitis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plots and Egger’s test."
