    "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies, accounting for more than 350,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and generating over $2.6 billion in direct costs. While most patients have mild disease, approximately 20–25% develop severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), characterized by persistent organ failure, systemic inflammation, and high rates of infectious complications. Mortality in SAP remains substantial despite advances in supportive care, and no pharmacological therapies are approved to directly target the inflammatory cascade driving disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have demonstrated immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties across critical illness. Proposed mechanisms in AP include suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), modulation of lipid mediators, enhancement of endothelial and immune cell function, and attenuation of oxidative stress. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses suggest that parenteral omega-3 supplementation may reduce infectious complications, shorten hospital stay, and in some cases, reduce mortality. Mechanistic studies further implicate lipotoxicity from long-chain fatty acids as a driver of AP severity, providing biologic plausibility for lipid-modulating interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet the existing evidence is fragmented. Prior reviews have combined heterogeneous populations, formulations, and dosing regimens without stratification. Guidelines from ESPEN and other societies do not recommend routine omega-3 supplementation in AP, citing the lack of large, definitive RCTs. Importantly, whether clinical benefit is dose-dependent or limited to specific subgroups (e.g., SAP, patients requiring parenteral nutrition) remains unanswered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to apply a dose-stratified framework to evaluate omega-3 fatty acids in AP. We will synthesize available RCTs to estimate the effects of omega-3 supplementation on key outcomes—including mortality, organ failure, infectious complications, inflammatory biomarkers, and length of stay—while assessing whether different dosing thresholds yield differential benefits. By clarifying the role of dose, this work aims to advance precision immunonutrition in AP and inform the design of future large-scale trials."
