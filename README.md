This repository contains a complete, reproducible analysis of childhood vaccination delays among 383 pediatric patients at a Children’s National primary care site in Columbia Heights, Washington, DC. The dataset includes de-identified records reflecting how many days children are overdue for ACIP-recommended vaccines, with ages ranging from 6 months to 18 years. All personal identifiers have been removed in accordance with HIPAA standards.

The project establishes a baseline description of vaccination delays to support the development of targeted interventions that strengthen timeliness of immunization. Delayed vaccination contributes meaningfully to the erosion of herd immunity within urban pediatric populations. Loss to follow-up appears to be the primary driver of overdue vaccines in this cohort. Baseline evaluation serves as the foundation for designing interventions that can stabilize coverage, reduce disparities, and improve clinic-level efficiency. The project integrates public health analytics with machine learning and applied quality-improvement planning in an accessible format suitable for clinicians, administrators, and data scientists.

This work illustrates responsible and transparent use of AI tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and GitHub Copilot, to support a doctoral-caliber analytic workflow in Python. All code is executable within Visual Studio Code using Jupyter notebooks. Interactive visualizations, a web app prototype, and a small predictive model are included to help staff identify risk patterns, explore overdue vaccine burdens, and simulate clinic workflow improvements.
