Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis
Overview

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in the United States, accounting for more than 350,000 hospitalizations annually and generating over $2.6 billion in direct costs. While most cases are mild, 20â€“25% progress to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), characterized by persistent organ failure, systemic inflammation, and a high risk of infectious complications. Mortality remains significant, and no pharmacological therapies are currently approved to directly target the inflammatory cascade driving disease progression.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in other critical illnesses. This project explores whether these properties can be leveraged to improve outcomes in acute and chronic pancreatitis.
